# Ubuntu/Debian Setup

A slightly opinionated, Ruby-focused dev environment. (Should) work for both real installs and Windows Subsystem for Linux.

* Build essentials
* rbenv with rbenv-plug, ruby-build, and few helpful plugins
* Ruby 2.5.1
* Node 10.x
* PostgresSQL, MySQL and SQLite database services/clients/libs
* Multimedia libraries for image/video/pdf manipulation & preview
