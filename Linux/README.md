# Linux Setup

A not-so opinionated web dev environment. Now with Fedora and Ubuntu flavors. Ubuntu scripts (Should) work for both real installs and Windows Subsystem for Linux. Common scripts are in this dir, specialized ones in their respective distro folder.

## Base setup

* Build essentials
* Multimedia libraries for image/video/pdf manipulation & preview
* Chromium & Chromedriver for automated testing

## Additional scripts

* rbenv with my favorite plugins and Ruby 2.5.3
* Node 11.x and Yarn
* PostgresSQL and SQLite database services/clients/libs
* Automatic Powertop tuning for extra battery life
* Rustup

## NOT included:

* An editor

Whichever one you prefer, they're easy enough to grab manually.

* Configs or dotfiles

These scripts are just meant to get things installed and ready. How you configure them is your business. If you wan to see mine, they're [here](https://github.com/macowie/dotfiles)
